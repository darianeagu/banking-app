# Banking app: Java 
This is the repository for the Banking app I created following the LinkedIn Learning course Hands-On Introduction: Java. 

Forked repository from LinkedInLearning with my own commits to create a functional app. 

This allows a customer to authenticate using their email and passsword, check their balance and deposit and withdraw money. Using given data tables of Customer and Accounts data, this creates a user interface where they can acces their individual account and update it.
